          ◉ I am interested in Software Development with a background in Data Engineering and Analytics. My experience with data allows me to tackle problems with deeper understanding of the product and business space.

          <br />◉ I want to contribute towards developing a meaningful product while tackling challenging problems. At the core, being able to work with something I am genuinely interested in is what creates fulfillment in what I do.
